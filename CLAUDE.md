### Rust

**Runtime:** Latest stable via `rustup`

| purpose | tool |
|---------|------|
| build & deps | `cargo` |
| lint | `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` |
| format | `cargo fmt` |
| test | `cargo test` |
| supply chain | `cargo deny check` (advisories, licenses, bans) |
| safety check | `cargo careful test` (stdlib debug assertions + UB checks) |

**Style:**
- Prefer `for` loops with mutable accumulators over iterator chains
- Shadow variables through transformations (no `raw_x`/`parsed_x` prefixes)
- No wildcard matches; avoid `matches!` macro—explicit destructuring catches field changes
- Use `let...else` for early returns; keep happy path unindented

**Type design:**
- Newtypes over primitives (`UserId(u64)` not `u64`)
- Enums for state machines, not boolean flags
- `thiserror` for libraries, `anyhow` for applications
- `tracing` for logging (`error!`/`warn!`/`info!`/`debug!`), not println

**Optimization:**
- Write efficient code by default — correct algorithm, appropriate data structures, no unnecessary allocations
- Profile before micro-optimizing; measure after

**Cargo.toml lints:**
```toml
[lints.clippy]
pedantic = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
# Panic prevention
unwrap_used = "deny"
expect_used = "warn"
panic = "deny"
panic_in_result_fn = "deny"
unimplemented = "deny"
# No cheating
allow_attributes = "deny"
# Code hygiene
dbg_macro = "deny"
todo = "deny"
print_stdout = "deny"
print_stderr = "deny"
# Safety
await_holding_lock = "deny"
large_futures = "deny"
exit = "deny"
mem_forget = "deny"
# Pedantic relaxations (too noisy)
module_name_repetitions = "allow"
similar_names = "allow"
```

### Bash

All scripts must start with `set -euo pipefail`. Lint: `shellcheck script.sh && shfmt -d script.sh`

### GitHub Actions

Pin actions to SHA hashes with version comments: `actions/checkout@<full-sha>  # vX.Y.Z` (use `persist-credentials: false`). Scan workflows with `zizmor` before committing. Configure Dependabot with 7-day cooldowns and grouped updates. Use `uv` ecosystem (not `pip`) for Python projects so Dependabot updates `uv.lock`.

## Workflow

**Before committing:**
1. Re-read your changes for unnecessary complexity, redundant code, and unclear naming
2. Run relevant tests — not the full suite
3. Run linters and type checker — fix everything before committing

**Commits:**
- Imperative mood, ≤72 char subject line, one logical change per commit
- Never amend/rebase commits already pushed to shared branches
- Never push directly to main — use feature branches and PRs
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials — use `.env` files (gitignored) and environment variables

**Hooks and worktrees:**
- Install prek in every repo (`prek install`). Run `prek run` before committing. Configure auto-updates: `prek auto-update --cooldown-days 7`
- Parallel subagents require worktrees. Each subagent MUST work in its own worktree (`wt switch <branch>`), not the main repo. Never share working directories.

**Pull requests:**
Describe what the code does now — not discarded approaches, prior iterations, or alternatives. Only describe what's in the diff.

Use plain, factual language. A bug fix is a bug fix, not a "critical stability improvement." Avoid: critical, crucial, essential, significant, comprehensive, robust, elegant.

## Project-specific instructions

- Update `USAGE.md` and `README.md` when updating the CLI specification.
- Keep different versions of README.md in sync with each other.
